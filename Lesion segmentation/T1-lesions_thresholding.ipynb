    "This code was used to create T1 lesion (black hole) masks through a thresholding technique. The tissue segmentations performed by the FSL algorithm FAST was used to extract grey matter segmentations. Subsequently the 5th percentile of the grey matter intensities was calculated, creating a threshold value. All voxels in the T2 lesions that had an intensity lower than this threshold, was classified as a black hole voxel."
